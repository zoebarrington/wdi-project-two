All the Gear, No Idea is a remake of the cycling blog that I wrote when I cycled across Canada in the summer of 2017. Users can sign in to write, edit, delete and comment/rate blogposts.

All the Gear, No Idea is my second project from General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. It was an individual project built within the space of a week. This project was my first attempt at backend technologies.

## Brief
To create a RESTful blog, restaurant review app or instagram clone. The app had to meet the following criteria:

* Has a user model and user authentication
* Allows users to edit, delete and add blogposts and blogpost comments
* Has a blog model and a comments/rating model
* Is styled with Bulma, but doesn't look like Bulma
